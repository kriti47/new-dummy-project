                                                <p>The law assignments are very much tricky and requires a lot of concentration because there are several laws associated with a single crime, it requires fine investigation and discussion of the topic, the laws associated with it and further the explanation for the selection of the appropriate act, its section or subsection or in fact sub-subsection (if exists). Thus, to understand all these, the individual needs to first develop a thorough knowledge of how many types of crimes are there and their associated acts, the terms and conditions associated with it and so on.
