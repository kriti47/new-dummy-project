The only difference that has been witnessed in this post-modern age is that of the broadening of the concept of social media and its role in raising social awareness about various issues which require the attention of the people. On the basis of the survey conducted it has been found out that at least 50 percent of the total world population remains online on some social media site at a given point of time, which is about 3.5 billion, and the total population of the world is approximately 7.7 billion. Majority of the active users and subscribers to the various social media sites are however from the developed world, and that of the less developed world is much less, on a comparative basis (Mallick and Bajpai 2019).Gone are the days when television and radio used to be the only source of social media to communicate messages and information having social relevance.

The social networking sites were primarily meant for people to keep in touch with their beloved ones and acquaintances for leisure purposes and for strengthening the personal connections between the people. However with the passage of time, the popularity of its usage has been observed and its advantage in the dissemination of social messages has been co-opted by several governmental and non-governmental organizations (Tilwankar, Rai, and Bajpai 2019).Social networking sites have not however replaced the traditional modes of mass media, such as television and radio, however, they are definitely functioning as subsidiaries to the existing news channels and other social media sites, and are thus complementing each other in the dissemination of socially relevant messages (Mavrodieva et al 2017).</p> <p>The usage of digital media is not a novel discovery which is typical to this age as television and radio have been in usage for quite a long period of time now.
